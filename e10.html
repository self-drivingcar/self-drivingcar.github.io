	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<h2>Ending 10</h2>
	<br />
	<span>You still drive your car around as a private cab driver. As self-driving cars become more common, you are getting less customers day by day.

You regret what you said to Kevin and wish you have agreed to implement self-driving cars even if it was a lie. </span>
