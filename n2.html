	<span>Kevin looks very pleased with your response. A month later, most cab drivers have been laid off, and you are now the manager as he promised. Most taxis from this company are now level 5 self-driving cars.</span>

	<span>You see in the news that there was a car accident involving the new self-driving car from your company. You also get a call from Langone Hospital saying that Mary and Joseph are heavily injured from a car accident. Joseph broke his rib bone and Mary broke her leg. It turns out that the self-driving car hit the school bus trying to save Sophie, who was jaywalking as many New Yorkers do. Who do you blame?</span>
