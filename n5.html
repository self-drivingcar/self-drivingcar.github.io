	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<span>You are outrageous about what happened. You confront Kevin and sue the company. Kevin is very disappointed in you and decides to hire a new manager to replace you. The judge concludes that because the company did not have any control over what the car would do, the taxi company does not have full responsibility for the accident. The taxi company is required to pay a small fine, but it can still continue using self-driving cars.</span>
