	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<h2>Ending 8</h2>
	<br />
	<span>The car insurance company covers everything from the car repair to the accident. Few weeks later, the car repairing service finds out from the log that the car actually suggested you turn left. They report this to the insurance company and now they are demanding the money back from you. The self-driving car technology team also wants to sue you for defamation. You regret lying about what had happened, but itâ€™s too late. </span>
