	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<span>Kevin thinks about it for a minute and decides to go with your suggestion. A month later, most taxis are replaced with level 3 self-driving cars with the same cab drivers still working at the company. You didn’t get the promotion because Kevin has to continue to pay other drivers. </span>
	<br /><br />
	<span>While you’re driving the newly implemented level 3 self-driving car, you see a woman run into the road. Your car suggests making a sharp left to save her life and hitting the school bus next to you instead. What do you do?</span>
