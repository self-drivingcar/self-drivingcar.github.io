	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<span>The woman, Sophie, is safe. However, your car hits the school bus next to you on its right side. Your car calls 911 immediately and you find out that Mary and Joseph were in the bus as well. Thankfully, there were no major injuries from the car crash. </span>
	<br /><br/>
	<span>You get contacted by a news reporter saying that she wants to interview you on the effectiveness on self-driving cars based on the accident the other day. You agree to do the interview and she asks if you think self-driving cars are safer than you driving the car. How do you answer?</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	<a href = "e5.html">Option 1</a>
	<br />
	<span>"Yes. If I was driving the car, I would not have reacted quick enough to prevent Sophie from getting hit by the car.”</span>
	<br />
	<a href = "e6.html">Option 2</a>
	<br />
	<span>"No, I think I would have been able to hit the brakes and stopped the car hitting nothing. And the car behind me was distanced enough to stop before hitting my car.”</span>
