	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<span>Kevin looks very displeased with your response. He fires you and you are now a private cab driver with no company.</span>
	<br /><br/>
	<span>While you are driving your car, you see a woman run into the road. You instinctively turn the wheel to change direction. You did not hit the woman, but you hit a school bus instead. It turns out that your kids Mary and Joseph were in the bus. They were not injured severely, but this accident reminds you of your conversation with Kevin. You think Kevin was right and should use self-driving cars. Do you go back to him and tell him what you think?</span>
