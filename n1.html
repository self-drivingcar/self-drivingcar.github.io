	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<span>Your boss, Kevin, is very interested in using level 5 (full automation) self-driving cars for his taxi company. These cars do not require drivers, so he plans on firing a lot of the drivers once implemented; however, he suggests that you would get promoted to a manager and stay in his company. You have built a very close relationship with the other cab drivers in this company, and you also know most of them will struggle to find another job if they were to get fired from their current job. He asks what you think about this idea.</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	<a href = "n2.html">Option 1</a>
	<br />
	<span>“Yes, I think self-driving cars would be a great asset to our company. Let’s do it!”</span>
	<br />
	<a href = "n3.html">Option 2</a><br />
	<span>“No, I think it is too early to be thinking about self-driving cars, but maybe we can test drive level 3 (conditional automation) self-driving cars.”</span>
	<br />
	<a href = "n4.html">Option 3</a><br />
	<span>“No, our cab drivers have been nothing but great and stayed loyal to our company for many years. I cannot believe you would think of firing most of them to save money!”</span>
