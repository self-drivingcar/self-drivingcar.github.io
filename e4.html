	<h1>Self-Driving Cars Game Book</h1>
	<h2>Ending 4</h2>
	<br />
	<span>The judge decides that because she jaywalked on the street which caused the accident, she has to pay a fine for jaywalking and also compensate you for the accident. The judge also concludes that her son still needs her and so she will not be incarcerated but will have to do community service for the next 3 months. After the case is closed, you wonder how this wouldâ€™ve been different if the taxi company never implemented the self-driving cars. Would have Sophie died from that? Is it better that your kids got injured rather than a 2-year-old kid losing his mom? </span>
